# List some of the features that would be inefficient in predicting tomorrow's rainfall. There will be a question in the quiz that follows based on this observation.

# %% [markdown]
# RainToday wouldn't be ideal as it needs a full day of data.

# %% [markdown]
# If we adjust our approach and aim to predict todayâ€™s rainfall using historical weather data up to and including yesterday, then we can legitimately utilize all of the available features. 

# %%
df = df.rename(columns={'RainToday': 'RainYesterday',
                        'RainTomorrow': 'RainToday'

# %% [markdown]
# ## Data Granularity
#

# %% [markdown]
# Would the weather patterns have the same predictability in vastly different locations in Australia? Probably not.  
# The chance of rain in one location can be much higher than in another. 
# Using all of the locations requires a more complex model as it needs to adapt to local weather patterns.  
# Let's see how many observations we have for each location, and see if we can reduce our attention to a smaller region.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Location selection
#
# Watsonia is only 15 km from Melbourne, and the Melbourne Airport is only 18 km from Melbourne.  
# Let's group these three locations together and use only their weather data to build our localized prediction model.  
# Because there might still be some slight variations in the weather patterns we'll keep `Location` as a categorical variable.

# %%
df = df[df.Location.isin(['Melbourne','MelbourneAirport','Watsonia',])]
df. info()


# %% [markdown]
# We still have 7557 records, which should be enough to build a reasonably good model.  

# %% [markdown]
# ## Extracting a seasonality feature
#
# Now consider the `Date` column. We expect the weather patterns to be seasonal, having different predictablitiy levels in winter and summer for example.  
# There may be some variation with `Year` as well, but we'll leave that out for now.
# Let's engineer a `Season` feature from `Date` and drop `Date` afterward, since it is most likely less informative than season. 
# An easy way to do this is to define a function that assigns seasons to given months, then use that function to transform the `Date` column.
#

# %%
def date_to_season(date):
    month = date.month
    if (month == 12) or (month == 1) or (month == 2):
        return 'Summer'
    elif (month == 3) or (month == 4) or (month == 5):
        return 'Autumn'
    elif (month == 6) or (month == 7) or (month == 8):
        return 'Winter'
    elif (month == 9) or (month == 10) or (month == 11):
        return 'Spring'


# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 1: Map the dates to seasons and drop the Date column
#

# %%
# Convert the 'Date' column to datetime format
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Apply the function to the 'Date' column
df['Season'] = df['Date'].apply(date_to_season)

df=df.drop(columns=['Date'])
df['Season'].value_counts()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 2. Define the feature and target dataframes
#

# %%
X = df.drop(columns='RainToday', axis=1)
y = df['RainToday']

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 3. How balanced are the classes?
#

# %%
y.value_counts()

# %% [markdown]
# The classes are imbalanced, there are roughly 3x more days without rain than with rain.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Exercise 4. What can you conclude from these counts?
# - How often does it rain annually in the Melbourne area?
# - How accurate would you be if you just assumed it won't rain every day?
# - Is this a balanced dataset?
# - Next steps?

# ## Try another model
# #### Some thoughts.
# In practice you would want to try out different models and even revisit the data analysis to improve
# your model's performance. Maybe you can engineer better features, drop irrelevant or redundant ones, project your data onto a dimensional feature space, or impute missing values to be able to use more data. You can also try a larger set of parameters to define you search grid, or even engineer new features using cluster analysis. You can even include the clustering algorithm's hyperparameters in your search grid!
#
# With Scikit-learn's powerful pipeline and GridSearchCV classes, this is easy to do in a few steps.

# ## Exercise 15. Update the pipeline and the parameter grid
